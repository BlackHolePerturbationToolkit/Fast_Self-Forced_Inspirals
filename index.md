C++ code to compute self-force inspirals rapidly using the near-identity transformed (NIT’d) equations of motion.

## Getting the code

The latest development version will always be available from the project git
repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/Fast_Self-Forced_Inspirals.git
```

## Requirements, Installation and Usage

For details on these topics check out the [README](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/Fast_Self-Forced_Inspirals/blob/master/README.md)

## Status

The NIT inspiral model is constructed using the self-force model from [N. Warburton et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6908) Consequently it is only valid for Schwarzschild inspirals with initial parameters 0 <= e <0.2 and 6+2e < p < 12. This will be extended in the near future using the self-force model of [T. Osburn et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01498) The plan is also to extend the model to generic inspirals in Kerr spacetime.
